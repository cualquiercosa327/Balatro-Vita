# Balatro Port for the PS VITA

===
#### YOU HAVE TO LEGALLY OWN A COPY OF BALATRO ON STEAM TO PLAY THIS PORT.
#### OVERLCLOCKING IS VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.
#### WE HAVEN'T TRIED ANY CRAZY RUNS AND DON'T KNOW HOW THE VITA HANLDLES IT

Credits to Jafeth ([Github](https://github.com/Jafeth12), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Skrubaso/)) for helping a lot with actually porting the game.

## Known issues, currently being worked on:
- Flame shader not working.
- Game runs at around 20fps.
- Shaders take a long time to compile.
- Touchscreen does not work.

## Instructions to apply port

- Download both the VPK and the ZIP file included in the latest Release.
- Extract the zip file wherever you want.
- Copy Balatro.exe (YOUR_STEAM_INSTALLATION_PATH/steamapps/common/Balatro/Balatro.exe) to the folder where the extracted zip resides.

#### IF YOU'RE ON WINDOWS:

- Execute windows_patch.bat to apply the patch.

#### IF YOU'RE ON UNIX (LINUX/MAC):

- Install xdelta3 using your packet manager of choice (PATCH WILL NOT APPLY PROPERLY IF ANY OTHER VERSION OF IS USED, HAS TO BE xdelta3).
    - Mac (using brew): ```brew install xdelta``` (we dont have mac, we cant try this out. if any mac user can confirm this does actually install xdelta3 and works it would be appreciated)
    - Debian/Ubuntu: ```sudo apt install xdelta3```
    - Arch: ```sudo pacman -Syu xdelta3```
    - Fedora: ```sudo dnf install xdelta```
- Execute unix_patch.sh to apply the patch.


#### AFTER PATCHING:

- In your Vita, open VitaShell to connect the console with your PC and copy both the VPK and the patched _game.love_ file.
- Install the VPK on your Vita.
- Copy the _game.love_ file to ux0:/app/BALA00001/
- Enjoy!
